## Trade-offs

- **Simplicity vs. Features:** The app focuses on core spreadsheet functionality (cell editing, basic formulas) to keep the codebase simple. Advanced features like multi-sheet support and complex formula parsing are not included.
- **Performance:** For small datasets, performance is adequate. Large spreadsheets may require optimization.
- **Validation:** Minimal input validation is implemented to prioritize ease of use.
- **State Management:** The app uses local state for simplicity. For larger applications, consider using a state management library like Redux or Context API.    

Feel free to customize or extend the application as needed.
